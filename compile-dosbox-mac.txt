Here's how I build for macOS included for my benefit. Perhaps it will help you too, perhaps not...

--- Prepare SDL ---

get latest SDL from here: https://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/shortlog/19d8c3b9c251 ; extract to SDL-1.2.15 folder

cd $HOME/DWDEV/Projects/dosbox-git/SDL-1.2.15
./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=$HOME/DWDEV/Projects/dosbox-git/extlib --enable-static --disable-shared --disable-video-x11

# official 1.2.15 needs this line to compile:
# perl -ni -e 'print unless /CGDirectPaletteRef/' ./src/video/quartz/SDL_QuartzVideo.h

make
make install


--- Compile DOSBox ---

cd $HOME/DWDEV/Projects/dosbox-git/dosbox-gridc
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-sdl-prefix=$HOME/DWDEV/Projects/dosbox-git/extlib --enable-force-gamelink
make
mv src/dosbox src/dosbox_gamelink
./configure --with-sdl-prefix=$HOME/DWDEV/Projects/dosbox-git/extlib
make
